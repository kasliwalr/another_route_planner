# another_route_planner
An evolving planner - going from A to B in creative ways. The project build a GoogleMap like application. We are given a Gmap like representation of the world. We are supposed to render it for viewing. The user can then supply two locations on the map, a source and a destination. Once these location are supplied, the application then generates the shortest route from source to the destination, this route is also rendered onto the map.
